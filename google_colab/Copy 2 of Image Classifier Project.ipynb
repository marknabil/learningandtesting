For example, you might want to include an image classifier in a smart phone app. To do this, you'd use a deep learning model trained on hundreds of thousands of images as part of the overall application architecture. A large part of software development in the future will be using these types of models as common parts of applications. \n","\n","In this project, you'll train an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers. You can imagine using something like this in a phone app that tells you the name of the flower your camera is looking at. In practice you'd train this classifier, then export it for use in your application. We'll be using [this dataset](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html) of 102 flower categories, you can see a few examples below. \n","\n","<img src='https://i.imgur.com/6n64KAw.png' width=500px>\n","\n","The project is broken down into multiple steps:\n","\n","* Load and preprocess the image dataset\n","* Train the image classifier on your dataset\n","* Use the trained classifier to predict image content\n","\n","We'll lead you through each part which you'll implement in Python.\n","\n","When you've completed this project, you'll have an application that can be trained on any set of labeled images. Here your network will be learning about flowers and end up as a command line application. But, what you do with your new skills depends on your imagination and effort in building a dataset. For example, imagine an app where you take a picture of a car, it tells you what the make and model is, then looks up information about it. Go build your own dataset and make something new.\n","\n","First up is importing the packages you'll need. It's good practice to keep all the imports at the beginning of your code.

You'll need to convert the values. It's easiest with a Numpy array, which you can get from a PIL image like so `np_image = np.array(pil_image)`.\n","\n","As before, the network expects the images to be normalized in a specific way. For the means, it's `[0.485, 0.456, 0.406]` and for the standard deviations `[0.229, 0.224, 0.225]`. You'll want to subtract the means from each color channel, then divide by the standard deviation. \n","\n","And finally, PyTorch expects the color channel to be the first dimension but it's the third dimension in the PIL image and Numpy array. You can reorder dimensions using [`ndarray.transpose`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.transpose.html).

This method returns both the highest `k` probabilities and the indices of those probabilities corresponding to the classes. You need to convert from these indices to the actual class labels using `class_to_idx` which hopefully you added to the model or from an `ImageFolder` you used to load the data ([see here](#Save-the-checkpoint)). Make sure to invert the dictionary so you get a mapping from index to class as well.\n","\n","Again, this method should take a path to an image and a model checkpoint, then return the probabilities and classes.\n","\n","```python\n","probs, classes = predict(image_path, model)\n","print(probs)\n","print(classes)\n","> [ 0.01558163  0.01541934  0.01452626  0.01443549  0.01407339]\n","> ['70', '3', '45', '62', '55']\n","```"]},{"metadata":{"id":"CZsOKkvYPsEm","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"cell_type":"code","source":["def predict(image_path, model, top_num=5):\n","    # Process image\n","    img = process_image(image_path)\n","    \n","    # Numpy -> Tensor\n","    image_tensor = torch.from_numpy(img).type(torch.FloatTensor)\n","    # Add batch of size 1 to image\n","    model_input = image_tensor.unsqueeze(0)\n","    \n","    image_tensor.to('cpu')\n","    model_input.to('cpu')\n","    model.to('cpu')\n","    \n","    # Probs\n","    probs = torch.exp(model.forward(model_input))\n","    \n","    # Top probs\n","    top_probs, top_labs = probs.topk(top_num)\n","    top_probs = top_probs.detach().numpy().tolist()[0] \n","    top_labs = top_labs.detach().numpy().tolist()[0]\n","    \n","    # Convert indices to classes\n","    idx_to_class = {val: key for key, val in    \n","                                      model.class_to_idx.items()}\n","    top_labels = [idx_to_class[lab] for lab in top_labs]\n","    top_flowers = [cat_to_name[idx_to_class[lab]] for lab in top_labs]\n","    return top_probs, top_labels, top_flowers"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"Ak_pOQ75PsEo","colab_type":"text"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Sanity Checking\n","\n","Now that you can use a trained model for predictions, check to make sure it makes sense.
